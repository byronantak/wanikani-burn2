## About The Project

This is a project to rewrite the old and outdated [tampermonkey script](https://community.wanikani.com/t/outdated-userscript-burn-reviews-ver-225/13423) to add a widget on the [WaniKani](https://knowledge.wanikani.com/getting-started/how-wanikani-works/) dashboard to be able to review the older Kanji and Vocab which the user might not get tested on anymore in WaniKani.
